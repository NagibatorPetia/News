This is a project consisting of a site in which there are pages. Also on all pages there is animation, conscious using JavaScript and not a standard CSS design.

It contains informative pages, which, thanks to the "flexible" interface, are very convenient to work with.
To work with the site code, you need to have some knowledge of HTML-5, JavaScript and CSS, which is a repulsive factor for this project.

## To start working with the Site you need:

1. Basic knowledge of HTML-5, JavaScript, CSS

2. Access to the terminal (console), stable Internet

3. Application for editing code.

4. Access to the Git library and Workbox library

**npm install**

**npm run-script build**

**npm start**

Open the browser tab for http://localhost:**** (**** - your server address, 8081 for example)
